# TodoAkita

A tiny exploration into the [Akita](https://github.com/datorama/akita) state management library.

[Demo Site](http://todo-akita.prettycool.link/)

## Features

You can add AND remove todos! Also, they persist in your localStorage through Akita's `persistState()` enhancer, so that's pretty cool.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
